Welcome to this introductory statistics course for geoscientists. Here you
will find a series of lectures focused on learning practical statistics skills
using <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>
which is a friendly "web-based interactive computational environment where you
can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a
single document".
<br/><br/>
The full lecture series can be accessed <a href="lecture_series">here</a> if you are
revising or want to forge ahead. Otherwise follow the series of posts below
each week as we make our way through the material.
