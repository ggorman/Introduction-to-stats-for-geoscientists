      "1. I have two sets of trilobite fossils from different localities. I think they are from the same species but want some quantitative confirmation \u2013 on the basis of their mean length:width ratio (triloshape1.csv, triloshape2.csv) is there evidence that they are different?\n",
      "2. I have measured mica percentages in samples of igneous rocks from two different localities (micapercent1.csv, micapercent2.csv). The mean mica percentage is lower in the second locality and I have a geological theory that may explain this, but I first need to rule out the possibility that the lower mica content is just due to chance.\n",

      "* Test whether their means differ significantly. When testing if the means are different you should use use either a two-tailed Mann-Whitney p value, or a two-tailed T-test p value depending on the result of the normality test. Remember that the scipy.stats Mann-Whitney function returns a one-tailed p-value \u2013 you will need to convert to two-tailed.\n",
