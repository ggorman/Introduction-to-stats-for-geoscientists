This is a 1<sup>st</sup> year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by Gerard Gorman and Christian Jacobs at Imperial College London. The course objectives are:

* Introduce practical statistics.
* Learn to perform statistics using Python.

Students should already be comfortable with the material covered in [Introduction to programming for geoscientists](http://ggorman.github.io/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/).As before, you will be using [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document.
